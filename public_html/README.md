# wat dis?
it's an HTML page I use as my home page.
URL: https://loona-il.000webhostapp.com/ (local use is recommended, but i've decided to have an additional remote instance).

Note: it's shit and useless for anyone who isn't me, probably.

# TO DO:
- add or replace the current playlist with my discover weekly or whatever
- change the logo of firefox to librewolf
- reorder the sites so similar types of sites (e.g. SNS, scrobbling) will be grouped together
- https://gitlab.com/ (?)
- remove useless files
